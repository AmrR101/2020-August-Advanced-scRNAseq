# Generating Gene Expression Matrices


Unfortunately, Cellranger expects a very specific filename format, the bcl2fasq output, so we need to rename the htstream output files.

```bash
mv /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/01-HTStream/654_small_htstream/654_small_htstream_R1.fastq.gz  /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/01-HTStream/654_small_htstream/654_small_htstream_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
mv /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/01-HTStream/654_small_htstream/654_small_htstream_R2.fastq.gz  /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/01-HTStream/654_small_htstream/654_small_htstream_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

### For the sake of time (building references can take hours) we are going to link a finished references, but when time allows

```bash
cd /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing
ln -s /share/biocore/workshops/2020_scRNAseq/Reference .
```

### When time allows, lets buld a reference for Mouse base on Ensembl release-100

First lets setup a References folder for our experiment.
```bash
mkdir /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/reference
cd /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/reference
```

We'll need to download and extract a number of reference files.
```bash
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.100.gtf.gz

## 10X Genomics - cellranger

Description of cellranger can be found [here](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger)

10X Genomics cellranger uses the [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) aligner under the hood to map reads to a genome after first preprocessing them (extracting cell and UMI sequences).

cellranger version 3 has many sub-applications

1. cellranger mkfastq

2. cellranger count
3. cellranger aggr
4. cellranger reanalyze
5. cellranger mat2csv

6. cellranger mkgtf
7. cellranger mkref

8. cellranger vdj

9. cellranger mkvdjref

10. cellranger testrun
11. cellranger upload
12. cellranger sitecheck

### Building indexes for cellranger (takes a long time)
10X Genomics provides pre-built references for human and mouse genomes to use with Cell Ranger. Researchers can make custom reference genomes for additional species or add custom marker genes of interest to the reference, e.g. GFP. The following tutorial outlines the steps to build a custom reference using the cellranger mkref pipeline.

```bash
cd /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER/scrnaseq_processing/reference

module load cellranger/4.0.0

### Counting (expression matrix) with cellranger

#### Cell barcode and UMI filtering

* Cell barcodes
	* Must be on static list of known cell barcode sequences
	* May be 1 mismatch away from the list if the mismatch occurs at a low- quality position (the barcode is then corrected).

* UMIs (Unique Molecular Index)
	* Must not be a homopolymer, e.g. AAAAAAAAAA
	* Must not contain N
	* Must not contain bases with base quality < 10
	*	UMIs that are 1 mismatch away from a higher-count UMI are corrected to that UMI if they share a cell barcode and gene.

#### Genome Alignment
cellranger uses an aligner called STAR, which performs splicing-aware alignment of reads to the genome. cellranger uses the transcript annotation GTF to bucket the reads into exonic, intronic, and intergenic, and by whether the reads align (confidently) to the genome. A read is exonic if at least 50% of it intersects an exon, intronic if it is non-exonic and intersects an intron, and intergenic otherwise.

#### MAPQ adjustment
For reads that align to a single exonic locus but also align to 1 or more non-exonic loci, the exonic locus is prioritized and the read is considered to be confidently mapped to the exonic locus with MAPQ 255.

#### Transcriptome Alignment
cellranger further aligns exonic reads to annotated transcripts, looking for compatibility. A read that is compatible with the exons of an annotated transcript, and aligned to the same strand, is considered mapped to the transcriptome. If the read is compatible with a single gene annotation, it is considered uniquely (confidently) mapped to the transcriptome. Only reads that are confidently mapped to the transcriptome are used for UMI counting.

### UMI Counting

* Using only the confidently mapped reads with valid barcodes and UMIs,
	* Correct the UMIs
		UMIs are corrected to more abundant UMIs that are one mismatch away in sequence (hamming distance = 1).
	* Record which reads are duplicates of the same RNA molecule (PCR duplicates)
	* Count only the unique UMIs as unique RNA molecules
	* These UMI counts form an unfiltered gene-barcode matrix.

### Filtering cells (the 10x way)

cellranger 3.0 introduces and improved cell-calling algorithm that is better able to identify populations of low RNA content cells, especially when low RNA content cells are mixed into a population of high RNA content cells. For example, tumor samples often contain large tumor cells mixed with smaller tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and researchers may be particularly interested in the TIL population. The new algorithm is based on the EmptyDrops method (Lun et al., 2018).

The algorithm has two key steps:

1. It uses a cutoff based on total UMI counts of each barcode to identify cells. This step identifies the primary mode of high RNA content cells.
2. Then the algorithm uses the RNA profile of each remaining barcode to determine if it is an “empty" or a cell containing partition. This second step captures low RNA content cells whose total UMI counts may be similar to empty GEMs.

In the first step, the original cellranger cell calling algorithm is used to identify the primary mode of high RNA content cells, using a cutoff based on the total UMI count for each barcode. cellranger takes as input the expected number of recovered cells, N (see --expect-cells). Let m be the 99th percentile of the top N barcodes by total UMI counts. All barcodes whose total UMI counts exceed m/10 are called as cells in the first pass.

In the second step, a set of barcodes with low UMI counts that likely represent ‘empty’ GEM partitions is selected. A model of the RNA profile of selected barcodes is created. This model, called the background model, is a multinomial distribution over genes. It uses Simple Good-Turing smoothing to provide a non-zero model estimate for genes that were not observed in the representative empty GEM set. Finally, the RNA profile of each barcode not called as a cell in the first step is compared to the background model. Barcodes whose RNA profile strongly disagrees with the background model are added to the set of positive cell calls. This second step identifies cells that are clearly distinguishable from the profile of empty GEMs, even though they may have much lower RNA content than the largest cells in the experiment.

Below is an example of a challenging cell-calling scenario where 300 high RNA content 293T cells are mixed with 2000 low RNA content PBMC cells. On the left is the cell calling result with the cell calling algorithm prior to cellranger 3.0 and on the right is the current cellranger 3.0 result. You can see that low RNA content cells are successfully identified by the new algorithm.

#### Bam output

10x Chromium cellular and molecular barcode information for each read is stored as TAG fields:

| Tag	| Type	| Description
|:----- |:------ |:----- |
| CB	| Z		| Chromium cellular barcode sequence that is error-corrected and confirmed against a list of known-good barcode sequences. |
| CR	| Z		| Chromium cellular barcode sequence as reported by the sequencer. |
| CY	| Z		| Chromium cellular barcode read quality. Phred scores as reported by sequencer. |
| UB	| Z		| Chromium molecular barcode sequence that is error-corrected among other molecular barcodes with the same cellular barcode and gene alignment. |
| UR	| Z		| Chromium molecular barcode sequence as reported by the sequencer. |
| UY	| Z		| Chromium molecular barcode read quality. Phred scores as reported by sequencer. |
| BC	| Z		| Sample index read. |
| QT	| Z		| Sample index read quality. Phred scores as reported by sequencer. |
| TR	| Z		| Trimmed sequence. For the Single Cell 3' v1 chemistry, this is trailing sequence following the UMI on Read 2. For the Single Cell 3' v2 chemistry, this is trailing sequence following the cell and molecular barcodes on Read 1. |
| TQ	| Z		| Trimmed sequence quality. Phred scores as reported by the sequencer. No longer present in V3 |

The following TAG fields are present if a read maps to the genome __and__ overlaps an exon by at least one base pair. A read may align to multiple transcripts and genes, but it is only considered confidently mapped to the transcriptome it if mapped to a single gene.

| Tag	| Type	| Description
|:----- |:------ |:----- |
| TX	| Z		| Semicolon-separated list of transcripts that are compatible with this alignment. Transcripts are specified with the transcript_id key in the reference GTF attribute column. The format of each entry is [transcript_id],[strand][pos],[cigar], where strand is either + or -, pos is the alignment offset in transcript coordinates, and cigar is the CIGAR string in transcript coordinates. |
| AN	| Z		| Same as the TX tag, but for reads that are aligned to the antisense strand of annotated transcripts. V3 ONLY. |
| GX	| Z		| Semicolon-separated list of gene IDs that are compatible with this alignment. Gene IDs are specified with the gene_id key in the reference GTF attribute column. |
| GN	| Z		| Semicolon-separated list of gene names that are compatible with this alignment. Gene names are specified with gene_name key in the reference GTF attribute column. |
| MM	| i		| Set to 1 if the genome-aligner (STAR) originally gave a MAPQ < 255 (it multi-mapped to the genome) and cellranger changed it to 255 because the read overlapped exactly one gene. |
| RE	| A		| Single character indicating the region type of this alignment (E = exonic, N = intronic, I = intergenic). |

The following are feature barcoding TAG fields which are not aligned to the genome, but processed by the Feature Barcodng read processor. The BAM file will contain unaligned records for these reads, with the following tags representing the Feature Barcode sequence extracted from the read, and the feature reference it was matched to, if any. The BAM read sequence will contain all the bases outside of the cell barcode and UMI regions. V3 ONLY.

| Tag	| Type	| Description
|:----- |:------ |:----- |
| fb	| Z		| Chromium Feature Barcode sequence that is error-corrected and confirmed against known features barcode sequences from the feature reference. |
| fr	| Z		| Chromium Feature Barcode sequence as reported by the sequencer. |
| fq	| Z		| Chromium Feature Barcode read quality. Phred scores as reported by sequencer. |
| fx	| Z		| Feature identifier matched to this Feature Barcode read. Specified in the id column of the feature reference. |

## Mapping with Star Solo

[STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/2.7.3a/docs/STARsolo.md) is a turnkey solution for analyzing droplet single cell RNA sequencing data (e.g. 10X Genomics Chromium System) built directly into STAR code. STARsolo inputs the raw FASTQ reads files, and performs the following operations

error correction and demultiplexing of cell barcodes using user-input whitelist
mapping the reads to the reference genome using the standard STAR spliced read alignment algorithm
error correction and collapsing (deduplication) of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIa)
quantification of per-cell gene expression by counting the number of reads per gene
quantification of other transcriptomic features: splice junctions; pre-mRNA; spliced/unspliced reads similar to Velocyto
STARsolo output is designed to be a drop-in replacement for 10X CellRanger gene quantification output. It follows CellRanger logic for cell barcode whitelisting and UMI deduplication, and produces nearly identical gene counts in the same format. At the same time STARsolo is ~10 times faster than the CellRanger.

### Indexing for STAR (takes a long time)

## Mapping  with Salmon Alevin

[Alevin](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) is a tool — integrated with the salmon software — that introduces a family of algorithms for quantification and analysis of 3’ tagged-end single-cell sequencing data. Currently alevin supports the following two major droplet based single-cell protocols:

* Drop-seq
* 10x-Chromium v1/2/3

Alevin works under the same indexing scheme (as salmon) for the reference, and consumes the set of FASTA/Q files(s) containing the Cellular Barcode(CB) + Unique Molecule identifier (UMI) in one read file and the read sequence in the other. Given just the transcriptome and the raw read files, alevin generates a cell-by-gene count matrix (in a fraction of the time compared to other tools).

Alevin works in two phases. In the first phase it quickly parses the read file containing the CB and UMI information to generate the frequency distribution of all the observed CBs, and creates a lightweight data-structure for fast-look up and correction of the CB. In the second round, alevin utilizes the read-sequences contained in the files to map the reads to the transcriptome, identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions. Finally, a post-abundance estimation CB whitelisting procedure is done and a cell-by-gene count matrix is generated.

### First lets install and build the newest version of salmon (takes a little while)

```bash
cd /share/workshop/adv_scrnaseq/$USER
module load cmake

wget https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/archive/v1.3.0.tar.gz
